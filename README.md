## Overview
The **Password Analyzer** is a cybersecurity tool designed to evaluate password strength and provide feedback to enhance security. It checks passwords against multiple criteria, including length, character diversity, common password detection, and sequential/repetitive character patterns.

This project was developed as part of an internship at **Pinnacle Labs** to promote better password security and awareness.

## Features 🚀
-  Checks password length and character diversity
-  Detects common passwords
-  Identifies sequential/repetitive character patterns
-  Ensures password does not contain personal information
-  Provides a strength meter with visual feedback
-  Interactive UI using **ipywidgets** in Google Colaboratory

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Python** - Core language for development
- **Regular Expressions (re)** - For pattern matching and validation
- **ipywidgets** - Interactive UI components
- **Google Colaboratory** - Development environment

## Installation & Usage 📌

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Google Colaboratory (or Jupyter Notebook)
- Required Python libraries: `ipywidgets`, `re`

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smileycookie/Password_Analyzer.git
   cd password-analyzer
   ```
2. Open the **password_analyzer.py** file in Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all the cells to launch the interactive password strength analyzer.
4. Enter a password to analyze its strength and receive security recommendations.

## Future Improvements 🔮
- 🔄 **Entropy calculation** for better randomness evaluation
- 🔍 **Integration with Have I Been Pwned API** to check for breached passwords
- 📊 **Graphical password strength visualization**
- 🛡️ **Multi-factor authentication recommendations**
- 📌 **Standalone GUI application** using PyQt or Tkinter
